# Cirrus CLI

WIP CLI for executing Cirrus tasks locally. Currently can only validate Cirrus CI configuration file.

## Installation

### Releases

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/releases) for a pre-built `cirrus` binary for your platform.

### Go

If you have Go 1.14 installed, you can run:

```
go install github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/...
```

This will build and place the `cirrus` binary in `$GOPATH/bin`.

To be able to run `cirrus` command from anywhere, make sure that the `$GOPATH/bin` directory is added to your `PATH` environment variable (see [article in the Go wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) for more details).

## Usage

To validate a Cirrus CI configuration, simply switch to a directory where the `.cirrus.yml` is located and run:

```
cirrus validate
```
