/*
 * Provides a container compatible interface.
 *
 * This documentation describes the Podman v2.0 RESTful API. It replaces the Podman v1.0 API and was initially delivered along with Podman v2.0.  It consists of a Docker-compatible API and a Libpod API providing support for Podmanâ€™s unique features such as pods.  To start the service and keep it running for 5,000 seconds (-t 0 runs forever):  podman system service -t 5000 &  You can then use cURL on the socket using requests documented below.  NOTE: if you install the package podman-docker, it will create a symbolic link for /var/run/docker.sock to /run/podman/podman.sock  See podman-service(1) for more information.  Quick Examples:  'podman info'  curl --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock http://d/v1.0.0/libpod/info  'podman pull quay.io/containers/podman'  curl -XPOST --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock -v 'http://d/v1.0.0/images/create?fromImage=quay.io%2Fcontainers%2Fpodman'  'podman list images'  curl --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock -v 'http://d/v1.0.0/libpod/images/json' | jq

// InspectContainerHostConfig holds information used when the container was created. It's very much a Docker-specific struct, retained (mostly) as-is for compatibility. We fill individual fields as best as we can, inferring as much as possible from the spec and container config. Some things cannot be inferred. These will be populated by spec annotations (if available). Field names are fixed for compatibility and cannot be changed. As such, silence lint warnings about them. nolint

However, the exact path in use may not be what was used in the original CLI invocation - though it is guaranteed that the device node will be the same, and using the given path will be functionally identical.

Thus, 2.5 CPUs (fractional portions of CPUs are allowed) would be 2500000000 (2.5 billion). In 'docker inspect' this is set exclusively of two further options in the output (CpuPeriod and CpuQuota) which are both used to implement this functionality. We can't distinguish here, so if CpuQuota is set to the default of 100000, we will set both CpuQuota, CpuPeriod, and NanoCpus. If CpuQuota is not the default, we will not set NanoCpus.
